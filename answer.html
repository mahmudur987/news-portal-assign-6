                1.before ES6 people use var as a variable. now using let and const. 

                2.var can redeclare and reassign. Let can't redeclare but reassign. Const can't redeclare and also reassign able. 
                
                3.var can be declared without initialization. let can be declared without initialization. Const can't be declared without initialization. 
                
                4. The scope of a var variable is functional. The scope of a var variable is block. The scope of a var variable is block.  
                
                5. Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled.

11. regular function was used before ES6. Arrow function also called fat  arrow  function is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more     concise syntax for writing function expressions. 

2.  Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments object of the closest non-arrow parent function.     Nam ed and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions. 

3. Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible,       they can be called using the new keyword. 

   However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword. 

4. Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode. 

It means that the following is valid JavaScript: 

5.regular function need more line to declare but arrow function can declare in one line.

1. The forEach() method does not create a new array based on the given array.  

The map() method creates an entirely new array.  

The forEach() method returns “undefined“. 

The map() method returns the newly created array according to the provided callback function. 

2. Eeveryone work with call backfunction. 

3. foreach() return every element of aray 

Map() return a new array 

Filter() return a new array 

Find() return 1st element of condition. 

4. All that use for array

                1.templet string is an ES6 components  

                2. a template literal is just like a better version of a regular         JavaScript string. 
                
                3. The substitutions allow you to embed variables and expressions in a string. The JavaScript engine will automatically      replacethese     variables and expressions with their values. This feature is known as string interpolation. 
                
                4. A template tag carries the transformation on the template literal and returns the result string. 
                
                You place the tag at the beginning of the template before the backtick (`) character as follows: 
                
                5. Use the backtick to create a string literal for string interpolation.
